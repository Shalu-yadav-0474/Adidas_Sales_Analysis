## Project Goals
#### Adidas has been collecting data on a variety of key elements, including Retailer, Retailer Id, customer information, products, and geographic data. However, the data is currently unrefined and underutilized, presenting both challenges and opportunities for unlocking valuable insights.
#### In cleaning and analysing Adidas's data, meaningful insights can be extracted from the dataset to support the company’s various teams—including finance, sales, product, and marketing. By providing actionable data insights, our aim is to improve operational efficiencies and drive better decision-making, ultimately helping Adidas to optimize its processes and deliver superior products globally.
