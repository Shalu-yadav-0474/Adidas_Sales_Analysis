## Recommendations
### Sales Trends & Revenue

-	Capitalize on peak periods, such as July, by introducing seasonal promotions or limited-edition products to drive revenue spikes.
-	Monitor and address the declining AOV by implementing value bundles or loyalty programs to encourage higher spend per order.

### Order Count
-	Use the April 2020 and December 2021 order spikes to identify high-demand periods and prepare inventory accordingly.
-	Enhance operational efficiency during peak months by scaling fulfilment capacity and implementing flexible workforce management.
-	Focus on understanding drivers behind order peaks and replicate successful campaigns during similar future scenarios.

### Geographical Trends
-	Allocate marketing budgets and resources strategically, prioritizing the West region and other top-performing regions to maximize ROI.
-	Develop tailored campaigns for underperforming regions based on the preferences and purchasing behaviour of those markets.
-	Strengthen logistics and distribution networks in the top 10 states to maintain leadership and reduce delivery times

### Product Trends
